## Introduction
Educational institutions face significant challenges in managing student academic records, calculating GPAs, and generating comprehensive reports. Traditional manual processes are error-prone, time-consuming, and lack the flexibility required for modern academic management. This project addresses these challenges by developing a comprehensive Student Result Processing System that automates grade calculations, GPA computations, and result reporting.
         The system is designed with scalability and flexibility in mind, supporting multiple academic programs, semesters, and subjects while maintaining data integrity through comprehensive validation rules and automated triggers. The implementation showcases advanced SQL Server features including stored procedures for business logic encapsulation, triggers for automatic GPA updates, window functions for ranking calculations, and complex queries for comprehensive reporting.
